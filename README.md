# Zabbix 7.4 deployment method
git clone https://github.com/saumyajit/zabbix_cmdb.git /usr/share/zabbix/ui/modules/
```

### ⚠️ Modify manifest.json File

```bash
# ⚠️ For Zabbix 6.0, modify manifest_version
sed -i 's/"manifest_version": 2.0/"manifest_version": 1.0/' zabbix_cmdb/manifest.json
```

### Enable Module

1. Go to **Administration → General → Modules**.
2. Click **Scan directory** to scan for new modules.
3. Find "Zabbix CMDB" module and enable it.
4. Refresh the page, the module will appear under the **Inventory** menu as "CMDB" submenu, containing "Host List" and "Host Groups" subitems.

## Notes

- **Performance Considerations**: For large environments, consider limiting query result quantities appropriately.
- **Data Accuracy**: Displayed information is based on the current state of the Zabbix database.
- **Item Dependencies**: Display of CPU and memory information depends on corresponding item configuration.
